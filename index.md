I’m currently working on From Event Models to Event Schemata: Modal and Amodal Event Representations and the Role of Meta-Cognition for Dynamic Event Comprehension.

I’m currently learning github, Statistics with R, Tidyverse.

I’m looking to collaborate on Event Segmentation of Dynamic Scenes and media psychology.
