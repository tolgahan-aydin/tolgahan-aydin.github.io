I’m currently working on the project called: "From Event Models to Event Schemata: Modal and Amodal Event Representations and the Role of Meta-Cognition for Dynamic Event Comprehension".

I’m currently learning GitHub, Statistics with R, Tidyverse.

I’m looking to collaborate on Event Segmentation of Dynamic Scenes and Media Psychology.
